Hi, no source repo, and I did not use libapl.  But the source code can be 
displayed with the GNU APL command:

    )host 'cat' 'index.html' 'main.go'

in the REPL of https://trygnuapl.github.io.  Basically, a 480-line back end
Go HTTP server coupled to a 256-line HTML+javascript front end.  I'll do
a better writeup for the curious with the next update which will address
âŽ•PW and ]boxing.
